# AI-Driven Mental Health Support Chatbot

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-driven chatbot that provides mental health support by offering resources, coping strategies, and a safe space for users to express their feelings. The chatbot will utilize natural language processing to understand user input and provide relevant responses.

## Background

The problem of mental health awareness and accessibility is significant, as many people struggle with mental health issues but lack support or resources. This project addresses:
* Lack of immediate support for individuals seeking mental health assistance.
* Difficulty in accessing reliable mental health information.
* Stigma surrounding mental health discussions.

My personal motivation stems from a desire to help individuals cope with mental health challenges, as I believe everyone should have access to mental health resources and support.

## How is it used?

Users can interact with the chatbot via a web interface or messaging app. The solution is needed in various situations, such as:
* When individuals feel anxious or depressed and need immediate assistance.
* For those seeking reliable mental health information without judgment.
* To provide a platform for users to express their feelings and receive support.

## Data sources and AI methods

The project will rely on:
* Natural language processing libraries like NLTK or SpaCy for text analysis.
* Mental health resources and databases for accurate information.
* User interaction data to improve chatbot responses over time.

## Challenges

The project does not solve:
* In-person therapy needs for severe mental health issues.
* Potential misinterpretations of user input by the chatbot.
* Privacy and ethical considerations regarding user data.

## What next?

The project could grow to include:
* More advanced AI features for personalized support.
* Collaboration with mental health professionals to ensure the accuracy of information.
* Expansion to include multilingual support to reach a broader audience.

## Acknowledgments

* Inspiration from existing mental health apps and chatbots.
* Open source libraries and tools for natural language processing, such as [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) and [SpaCy](https://spacy.io/).
